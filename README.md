calcCMD
=======

A free command line calculator

calcCMD is designed to be an easy-to-use, Keep-It-Simple calculator for a line
interface. It enables the user to quickly make calculations without having to
deal with a GUI that might be tedious to work with.

calcCMD currently has two modes: classic and orderly. Just running `calccmd`
defaults to orderly mode, since the key advantage of using a program like
calcCMD is its ability to use the order of operations effectively. Running
`calccmd -c` will activate classic mode, which does all math operations in the
order they were entered.

Orderly calculations are verbose at this time, meaning they will fill the 
console with messages every time it makes a pass through the arguments.

calcCMD is free software, released under the GNU General Public License, meaning
you have the freedom to do as you wish with the software, including modifying,
distributing copies, and studying the source code. You are free to make your
own modified version and distribute/sell it as long as the freedoms you were
given are also given to your users (it must be released under the same license).

calcCMD was created initially by David McMackins during February of 2014 to
practice using Vim. The simplicity of the program makes it great for new and
aspiring C++ programmers to study the source code and learn how a simple
program works (with minimal understanding required). If you'd like to join the
